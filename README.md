# 🔐 zkSnarkUltimateSystemV1

Welcome! This project is a working example of how to build and use zk-SNARKs with [Circom](https://docs.circom.io) and [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs). It shows how you can prove something is true — like a calculation — without showing the actual data.

Think of it like saying “I know the answer” without ever showing the answer.

## ✨ What’s in This Project?

- A few simple zk circuits (like multiplying two numbers)
- Scripts to compile, generate keys, and produce proofs
- Example inputs and output files
- A placeholder for connecting this with a browser or smart contract later

---

## 🛠️ How to Use It

### 1. Compile a Circuit

```bash
circom circuits/multiplier.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o build
```

This creates the circuit's compiled files (like `.r1cs`, `.wasm`, and `.sym`).

---

### 2. Run the Trusted Setup

If you don’t have the `.ptau` file yet, generate one locally:

```bash
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 12 pot12_0000.ptau
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot12_0000.ptau powersOfTau28_hez_final_10.ptau --name="my test" -v
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 powersOfTau28_hez_final_10.ptau powersOfTau28_hez_final_10_prepared.ptau
```

---

### 3. Set Up the Proving Key

```bash
snarkjs groth16 setup build/multiplier.r1cs powersOfTau28_hez_final_10_prepared.ptau build/multiplier_setup.zkey
```

This step sets up the environment for creating zk-proofs.

---

### 4. Provide Inputs

Create a simple `input.json` file like this:

```json
{
  "a": "3",
  "b": "11"
}
```

This will be the secret input that gets proven.

---

### 5. Generate the Witness

```bash
node build/multiplier_js/generate_witness.js build/multiplier_js/multiplier.wasm input.json build/multiplier.wtns
```

This step evaluates the circuit using the inputs.

---

### 6. Generate the Proof

```bash
snarkjs groth16 prove build/multiplier_setup.zkey build/multiplier.wtns proof.json public.json
```

Now you’ve got a cryptographic proof that your input is valid!

---

### 7. Verify It

```bash
snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json
```

If everything is correct, it will say `OK`. Otherwise, the proof is invalid.

---

## 🔎 Why This Is Cool

- You can prove something without revealing your input.
- Everything works locally — no need for a blockchain or internet connection.
- You can plug this into a website or a smart contract later.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project is meant to teach and demonstrate the magic of zk-SNARKs. Tinker with it, break it, extend it — that’s how you learn.

Made for builders who like math, security, and a bit of magic. ✨
